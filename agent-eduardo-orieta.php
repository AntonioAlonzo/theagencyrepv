                  Eduardo is from Argentina. He was born in Rosario, the second-largest city in the country. He spent his years living, studying,
                  and working between Rosario and Buenos Aires.
                  From his Italian and Spanish family roots, he developed a taste for good food and curiosity for other cultures.
                  He lives in Puerto Vallarta since 2018, and when people ask about his decision to live in another country, he responses; "If you never try, you'll never know," a phrase from the song Fix You by Chris Martin, and now that same lyric is part of his life mantra.
                  <br><br>
                  He has a Business Administration degree. He has been working in luxury hotels for more than 15 years, where he developed different skills in areas such as Public Relations, Sales, and Management. He increased and improved his passion for human relationships and people wellness. He has knowledge in communications and coaching tools that have helped him understand the market's needs.
                  <br><br>
                  He spent his last years in Argentina working as a P.R. Manager for the biggest winery in the country. He developed and managed positioning strategies, products launching, exclusive events for wholesale and massive customers. He successfully improved the sales results of the winery. With all this experience, Eduardo makes their client's dreams come true.
                  <br><br>
                  He enjoys spending time in nature, going to the beach or on a yacht, always accompanied by a South American infusion Mate; he loves cooking at home for friends with a glass of good wine. He is passionate about going out to discover new restaurants, bars, and flavors. He is calling himself a Sibarita.
                  <br><br>
                  Since 2018 he has been a volunteer for S.E.T.A.C. setac.com.mx, a civil organization dedicated to educating and disseminating information about H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted infections (ITS).
